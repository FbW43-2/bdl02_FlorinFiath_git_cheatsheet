# GIt commands cheat-sheet: the most useful 
## 1.Navigate to your git project folder

Use `cd` to move between folders. E.g:
```
cd workspace
cd bdl02_FlorinFiath_git_cheatsheet

## 2. Check the status of the project

- `git status`

    With `git status` I can see some changes have happened and if some files are ready to be committed .
    It gives me an overview of the project at the specific moment in time.
- `git log`
- `git diff`
